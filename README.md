# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

"""" It is the systematic application of engineering principles methods and tools for the development and maintence of deployment annd maintenance of software products. """


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

"""  
1. The development of programming language - this allowed code to be written in a more human readable way.
2. Software engineering established as a discipline - this emphasized structured programming, software development methodologies and quality assurance
3. The rise of agile methodology - this encouraged continuous feedback, shorter development cycles and customer involvement

 """


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

"""
1. Requirements- this involves getting system requirements, gathering adn cocumenting the needs of the user.
2. Design- this involves design of the user interface.
3. Implementation: code generation according to design.
4. Testing- ensuring quality and functionality.
5. Deployment - customers get interact with the end product at this stage.
6. Maintenance - Providing support, updates, and changes to the software after deployment.

"""


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
""" Waterfall methodology- this method is more linear. one step preceeds another. for instance when baking a cake the process is linear as you follow one step to another to the final product.
Agile methodology - is more iterative where if the process does not work you can scale. An example of this is like a party planner where there needs to be feedback in order to execute the perfect plan according to the specifications of the client"""


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

""" Software Developer -  writing and implementing code for software solutions
Project Manager - they plan, execute and deliver software projects
Quality Assurance - they design and execute test plans 
"""


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
""" IDEs is an important tool for writing, debugging and testing code while VCS is important for collaboration of team members and tracking changes of code
"""


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
""" 
1. Changing requirements
2. Tight deadlines
3. Technical dept

These challenges can be solved by good communication within the team,planning and executing plans through agile methodologies, prioritizing tasks and the assessment of the overall goals of the project with a keen emphasis on timelines.
"""


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
"""


"""


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
""" 
It is creating questions and/or statements to get the best possible outcomes from AI models
"""

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
